# üóÑÔ∏è Database Lab with Neon + PostgreSQL

This repository demonstrates how to connect to a Neon-hosted PostgreSQL database using **Python** (`SQLAlchemy` + `pandas`) and run example SQL queries against the shared course dataset (`product`, `pc`, `laptop`, `printer`).  

The examples cover filtering, joining tables, aggregations, and subqueries, providing a full range of SQL practice for the class.
